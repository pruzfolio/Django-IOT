# IoT with Django Learning Roadmap

## 1. Beginner Level: Introduction to IoT with Django

### Topics:
- [ ] **Understanding IoT Basics**
  - [ ] What is IoT and how devices communicate (MQTT, HTTP, CoAP).
  - [ ] Basic architecture of an IoT system (Devices, Gateways, Backend, Frontend).
  
- [ ] **Using Django as a Data Receiver**
  - [ ] Setting up Django REST Framework to receive data via HTTP APIs.
  - [ ] Designing models for storing IoT data (e.g., temperature, humidity).

- [ ] **Setting Up a Simple IoT Device**
  - [ ] Use affordable devices like Raspberry Pi or ESP32.
  - [ ] Program the device to send data to Django using HTTP requests.

- [ ] **Data Visualization**
  - [ ] Render received IoT data in Django templates.
  - [ ] Use a library like Chart.js or Plotly for basic visualization.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Build a Weather Monitoring System**
  - [ ] Use ESP32 to send temperature and humidity data to Django via REST API.
  - [ ] Store the data in a PostgreSQL database.
  - [ ] Visualize real-time data using Django templates and Chart.js.

### Tools to Learn:
- [ ] **ESP32/Raspberry Pi**: For IoT devices.
- [ ] **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: For receiving and processing IoT data.
- [ ] **Chart.js**: For simple data visualization.

## 2. Intermediate Level: Advanced IoT Communication

### Topics:
- [ ] **Integrating MQTT Protocol**
  - [ ] Learn the basics of MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport).
  - [ ] Use an MQTT broker like Mosquitto or HiveMQ.
  - [ ] Set up Django to act as a subscriber using libraries like `paho-mqtt`.

- [ ] **Real-Time Data Processing**
  - [ ] Use Django Channels for WebSocket support.
  - [ ] Stream IoT data to the frontend in real-time.

- [ ] **Device Authentication**
  - [ ] Assign unique keys to devices for secure communication.
  - [ ] Implement JWT or API key-based authentication in Django.

- [ ] **Cloud Integration**
  - [ ] Send IoT data from Django to cloud platforms like AWS IoT Core or Google IoT.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Create a Home Automation Dashboard**
  - [ ] Control lights or appliances using MQTT.
  - [ ] Visualize real-time statuses on a Django-powered dashboard.
  - [ ] Secure device communication with API keys.

### Tools to Learn:
- [ ] **paho-mqtt**: For MQTT communication.
- [ ] **Django Channels**: For real-time WebSocket updates.
- [ ] **Mosquitto**: Open-source MQTT broker.

## 3. Advanced Level: IoT Data Management and Analysis

### Topics:
- [ ] **Data Storage and Optimization**
  - [ ] Store large IoT data streams efficiently using time-series databases like InfluxDB.
  - [ ] Use Django for querying and visualizing data.

- [ ] **Edge Computing**
  - [ ] Implement local processing on IoT devices.
  - [ ] Use Django to send updates and configurations to devices.

- [ ] **Predictive Analytics**
  - [ ] Integrate machine learning models in Django to predict trends from IoT data.
  - [ ] Use Python libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

- [ ] **Remote Firmware Updates**
  - [ ] Implement endpoints in Django to deliver firmware updates to IoT devices.
  - [ ] Secure update delivery with checksums and encryption.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Build an Industrial Monitoring System**
  - [ ] Use sensors to monitor machine parameters like temperature and vibration.
  - [ ] Store data in InfluxDB, process with Django, and visualize using Grafana.
  - [ ] Predict failures using a Django-integrated ML model.

### Tools to Learn:
- [ ] **InfluxDB**: For time-series data.
- [ ] **TensorFlow/Scikit-learn**: For ML integration.
- [ ] **Grafana**: For advanced data visualization.

## 4. Professional Level: Large-Scale IoT Ecosystems

### Topics:
- [ ] **Scalability and Load Balancing**
  - [ ] Use Django with Gunicorn and nginx for load balancing.
  - [ ] Scale Django with cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.

- [ ] **IoT Security**
  - [ ] Implement TLS encryption for data transmission.
  - [ ] Secure Django APIs with OAuth2 or API Gateways.

- [ ] **IoT Device Management**
  - [ ] Create an admin panel in Django for managing IoT devices (e.g., add, update, monitor).

- [ ] **Event-Driven Architecture**
  - [ ] Use message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka to handle high-frequency IoT data.

- [ ] **Edge-Cloud Communication**
  - [ ] Sync processed data from edge devices with Django running on the cloud.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Develop a Smart City Management System**
  - [ ] Collect data from IoT devices across multiple locations (e.g., streetlights, traffic signals).
  - [ ] Use Kafka for event-driven data processing.
  - [ ] Deploy a scalable Django backend on AWS and integrate with an IoT platform like AWS IoT Core.

### Tools to Learn:
- [ ] **Kafka/RabbitMQ**: For event-driven architecture.
- [ ] **AWS IoT Core**: For cloud-based IoT solutions.
- [ ] **TLS Certificates**: For secure communication.
